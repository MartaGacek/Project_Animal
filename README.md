# Project_Animal
This is the Deterministic Modelling project, based on the biology. I am using Math methods to model the apperance of an animal, precisely a bear. 

First of all I drew a diagram showing the bear and its „build parts”. Then I generated it using a code written in Python. I also created a suitable version of finite difference scheme and described the model. Then I used the scheme to compute the solutions and draw them on the diagram.

In the file called "class_bear" there is a class used to create the animal and show it on a diagram. The same code is in the "Animations" file, but it is updated - it has the ability to animate the changes in the pattern.

In the "Variance" file there are some plots that I generated in order to compare the diversity of patterns. Every picture shows the variance for different values of one of the system's parameters. The description is written in the report.
