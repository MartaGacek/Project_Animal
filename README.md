# Project_Animal
This is the Deterministic Modelling project, based on the biology. I am using Math methods to model the apperance of an animal, precisely a bear. First of all I drew a diagram showing the bear and its „build parts”. Then I generated it using a code written in Python. I also created a suitable version of finite difference scheme and described the model.
